# CreditWise Loan System

## 📌 Overview
CreditWise Loan System is an end-to-end **machine learning project** that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using supervised learning techniques.

The project focuses on building a complete ML pipeline including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **binary classification model** that accurately predicts loan approval status based on applicant and financial information.
